sit thee down and have no shame
cheek by jowl and knee by knee
what care i for any name
what for order or degree
 
let me screw thee up a peg
let me loose thy tongue with wine
callest thou that thing a leg
which is thinnest thine or mine
 
thou shalt not be saved by works
thou hast been a sinner too
ruined trunks on withered forks
empty scarecrows i and you
 
fill the cup and fill the can
have a rouse before the morn
every moment dies a man
every moment one is born
